## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
```

All of the content files can be found in `src/content/` directory.

Note: make sure not make any additional breaks at the ending or the beginning of a line inside the `<ResearchLink>` component or the build will fail.

Any static assets, like images or other files, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
