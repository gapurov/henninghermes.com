I am a behavioral and experimental economist focusing on topics in labor, education, and the formation of (noncognitive) skills. More recently, I have worked on the importance of early child care for life outcomes and inequality. In addition, I have projects in the areas of digital learning as well as paternalistic decision making. For my work, I mainly use field experiments but I also conduct lab, lab-in-the-field, and survey experiments. I studied Economics and Psychology at the University of Mainz, where I also pursued my PhD (supervised by Daniel Schunk and Ernst Fehr).

I co-organize the [Workshop on Field Experiments in Economics and Business](http://www.field-experiments.eu).
